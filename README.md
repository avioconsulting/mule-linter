#Mule Linter Tool
A linter is a tool that analyzes source code looking for patterns that donâ€™t follow convention.  Linting helps prevent errors and improve the overall quality of the code by following best practices.  Lint tools are a form of static code analyzers.  Some common code analyzers for Java are Checkstyle, FindBugs, and PMD.

The Mule Linter will enforce that all Mule projects are developed with a baseline set of rules.  Some basic examples of rules that will be enforced, are the proper usage of property and pom files, useful logging messages, and standard project structure.

## Code Coverage
[CodeNarc](https://codenarc.github.io/CodeNarc/) is used to ensure quality in groovy code.  The configuration file is located [here.](config/codenarc/codenarc.xml)  To execute run ```gradle check```, and an output [report](build/reports/codenarc/main.html) will be generated.
